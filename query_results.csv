Sources of Nation State Attacks:

1. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups: These are sophisticated and well-resourced cybercriminal organizations that are sponsored by nation states. They operate in a highly targeted and persistent manner, often using advanced techniques to breach their targets.

2. State-sponsored hacking groups: These are teams of hackers and cyber operatives that are directly sponsored and funded by nation states, and tasked with carrying out cyber espionage and sabotage against other nations.

3. Military and intelligence agencies: Several nations have specialized military and intelligence units that are dedicated solely to carrying out cyber attacks against other nations. These units often have advanced cyber capabilities and conduct both offensive and defensive operations.
